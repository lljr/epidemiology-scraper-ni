* TODO Catch 2 KeyErrors thrown in scraper output
  There are two unmapped keys in the scrapper.
  They correspond to the name of the disease. Due to MINSA's
  website structure, these two rogue keys are not related to
  any table. For now, it's ok to ignore, but preferably this
  error should be fixed.
